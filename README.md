## What is Practical CV?

**Practical CV** is a LaTeX **CV(Curriculum Vitae)** or **Résumé** template that aims for simplicity. It is inspired by [Butterick’s Practical Typography Résumés](https://practicaltypography.com/resumes.html). It has clearly commented modular sections to change various features like
  - fonts 
  - font size
  - spacing between sections
  - accent colour
  - icons

and many more.
